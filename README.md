You are a ghost who has happily lived in a dilapidated old mansion surrounded by its precious mementos from when it was alive for many years. 

But on one fateful day removalists arrived and set out to try and remove all of the mementos from the mansion.
Play as the ghost to protect your mementos and scare all of the movers away.

Scare the Movers while they are carrying your Mementos, and hover over dropped momentos to move them back to their original location.
